Built as a native Android application, it serves as your digital school bag — organizing everything you need for academic success in one place.\n\nThe app features a clean, intuitive interface that allows students to add assignments with due dates, set reminders, and track their overall college progress. Firebase integration ensures data is synced across devices and never lost.\n\nThis project is currently being remade with React Native and Expo to bring it to both iOS and Android with a modern, cross-platform approach.",
